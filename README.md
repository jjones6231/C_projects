# C_projects
a repository of projects I work on while I learn c

# reason
I love reverse engineering and vulnerability research. In order to be better at both of those fields, I want to get better at c. After c, I may work on c++ projects, but that will come later.

## sub reason
I really love c, and find it interesting that so much of the things we interact with on a dialy basis are built in it. Once I feel proficent enough, I would also like to try to build a more complex piece of software. Currently I want to make something that keeps track of how I spend money with a graphical component
